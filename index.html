            <p>My plan for this poster was to make a film camera in a dim room to create a cinematic
                ambiance. The camera's intention is to quickly, seamlesly educate to the audience
                what this festival is about.

            <p>For this poster I drew inspiration from the Hollywood sign in America.
                The Hollywood reference should immediately indicate to the audience that this festival
                is all about film. The grass text was used to keep an organic feel to the poster.

                create a mysterious room inticing the viewer towards the festival.

            <p>For this poster I wanted to take a "simple but effective" approach. The papersheet poster
                is a great eyecatcher when seen in unexpected locations, I used a handwritten font to really give
                a personal feel to the poster.

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>Creating this website and all of its content within was a fun however challenging (and sometimes incredibly rage inducing) task.
                Of course this task seemed incredibly daunting especially since I have no previous experience in code or any of the adobe products
                used (except Illustrator to a degree), but as I progressed referencing my code to the code found in the worksheets I found that this
                task may be within my skills. The biggest issue that I ran into creating this website would have to be placing images the way I wanted
                them to be, as every time I tried to change the position of the images new errors would be created in my code. To help me figure out the issues
                I was faced with I reconciled with my coursemate Ethan, Youtube, and the P5.js website. Overall this website was definitely a challenge
                but one that I enjoyed facing, I'm excited to see what the future of this course holds for me.
